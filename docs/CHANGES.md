# Changelog


#### 0.5.11

* `api.WimsAPI.authuser` now accept an `ip` argument, allowing a persistent session for the
  same IP. (Contributed by Gianluca Amato)


#### 0.5.10

* WIMS accept request saving user with invalid `quser`, removing or changing
  invalid character. But `wimsapi` was taking this change into account, the `quser`
  attribute of the user was thus invalid, causing problem when further communicating with
  the WIMS server.  
  To solve this problem `User.save()` now has a `adapt=True` keyword argument. When `True`,
  the `quser` attribute will be modified to match the one used by WIMS. If `False`, the
  user created on the WIMS server with the modifier `quser` will be deleted and the new
  exception `InvalidIdentifier` will be raised.


#### 0.5.9

* Keyword argument that will be passed to every call of `request.post()` can now
be given to `WimsApi` constructor.
* Every method of `Class` creating a `WimsAPI` can also receive such argument
(`check()`, `save()`, `get()`, `list()`)
* Now use `sdist` instead of `bdist` to create new distribution.

to store scores

* `Sheet` / `Exam`:
    * Title and description are now optionnal in constructor.
    * Added method `scores(user=None)` to retrieve the score of one or every user.

* Added class method `check()` to `Class` to check wheter a class exists or not.

* Better `__eq__` and `__hash__` for every class.


#### 0.4.1

* Listing functions now return an empty list when needed


### 0.4.0

* Added new item : `Sheet`
* Added the possibility to list items and classes through `Class.list()` and
    `class.listitem()`.
* Added `__eq__()` for items and classes.
* Fixed some documentation


#### 0.3.9

* Renamed Class member `date` to `expiration` to match the *ADM/RAW* argument.
* `Class.limit` is now an *int* when retrieving the class from a *WIMS* server.

#### 0.3.7 & 0.3.8

* `check_exists` is now used properly


#### 0.3.6

* Added `check_exists=True` parameter to item's save method.  
    If check_exists is True, the api will check if an item with the same ID
    exists on the WIMS' server. If it exists, save will instead modify this
    item instead of trying to create new one.  
    `wclass.additem()` will now use `check_exists=False`.
